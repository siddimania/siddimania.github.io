    In my undergrad years, I grew keen to implement my knowledge to solve students issues. That’s the reason I co-founded a digital solutions group named “JIITSimplified”. The team’s objective was to build a platform(Web, Android, and iOS applications) to provide application solution for Study Material, Food Menu, Attendance, Exam Seating Plan, Past Question Papers and Event Notifications. The main challenge that I overcame was the implementation of the optimized APIs and background services. The usage and design of the applications were well received by the faculties and students.
