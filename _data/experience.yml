    After completing my studies, I had worked with Eligible Inc.(New York) as a Software Engineer in Connection-Team. At Eligible, I learned about intricacies of the healthcare systems like the processes of eligibility & claims and how to securely transfer protected health information(PHI) to trading partners through EDI-x12. I handled important tasks like the implementation of real-time(270) & claim(837) connections and optimization of portal connections. As the team handled the core functionality of the company, I was vigilant at every stage.

    In the summer of 2014, I got an amazing opportunity to work as a Software Developer Intern at Zomato(India's largest restaurant search & discovery platform), New Delhi. Mainly, I worked on the cross-platform mobile application development and testing. The essence of the task was to determine the strengths and limitations of the framework. I was also given the responsibility to research and ascertain whether the company could use this framework to develop any future applications with a view of reducing implementation and maintenance costs. My biggest takeaway from this experience was how to effectively approach a unique problem.
