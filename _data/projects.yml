    The teamâ€™s objective was to build a platform(Web, Android, and iOS applications) to provide application solution for Study Material, Food Menu, Attendance, Exam Seating Plan, Past Question Papers and Event Notifications. The main challenge that I overcame was the implementation of the optimized APIs and background services. The usage and design of the applications were well received by the faculties and students. Now, the platform has more than 4000 active students.
